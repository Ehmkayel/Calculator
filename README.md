## Websites and Resources
When designing my webpage I used the below listed sites for the resources I needed;
- For the image I used [pexels](https://www.pexels.com) 

- I used [tiny png](https://tinypng.com) to compress my image

## Process
- I started by downloading image from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com) then compress it with [tiny png](https://tinypng.com)

- Then I built out the html page

- After completing the html page, I created a file for my style and I linked my style to my html by using an external link

- Then I started styling the html of the page 

## Technologies
- Html semantic tags
- Css selectors, flex and grid
- I used BEM (Block Element Modifier) to construct my html so I can style some buttons independently
- css variables
- Css custom properties
